    <h2>Student Life in Japan</h2>
    <p class="section-text">
      Japanese university life is vibrant and well-rounded. Students often join “circles” (casual clubs) or the more serious “bukatsu” (formal extracurriculars), such as cultural, sports, or academic clubs. These activities are a great way to make friends, develop leadership skills, and integrate into university life.
    </p>
    <p class="section-text">
      Campuses in Japan offer modern facilities like well-equipped libraries, affordable cafeterias, dormitories, gyms, and student lounges—designed to support both academic and personal growth.

    <h2>Living in Japan</h2>

    <p class="section-text">
      To get the most from your student budget, search for student discounts on transport, attractions, and cultural events. Explore local dishes such as ramen, sushi, and bento boxes—delicious and affordable.

    <h2>Cultural Experiences</h2>

      Living in Japan offers a unique mix of tradition and modernity. From participating in tea ceremonies, attending cultural festivals like cherry blossom viewing or university "bunkasai", to enjoying anime and J‑pop—there’s something for everyone.

    <h2>Daily Student Experience</h2>
    <p class="section-text">
      Balancing academics and social life is key. Japanese students often manage rigorous routines while benefiting from structured support and time-management strategies. Participating in circles, exploring cultural events, and leveraging support systems can make a huge difference.
